# Todo

- we should only have a single instance of the global cache (unless a different cache-path is set)
- add `cache clean`
- improve the autodetection code so that people don't need to supply a --main argument in default cases (e.g. when there is a index.js or there is just one file in the package)

## use detective

- provides more accurate exclusion information (e.g. modules not connected from the main file can be ignored; files like package.json can often be safely excluded)
- allows the user to only specify `--main` without any includes
- allows us to auto-detect node_modules dependencies without explicit include management (making live reload possible / nice)
- paves way for efficient node core module support

Implementation:

- should work as a preprocessing step
- first, apply resolution (use cached data if possible)
- next, add more files to the build if detected
- next, apply normal filters such as .npmignore and .gitignore

Test cases:

- exclude unused file like package.json
- include unmentioned file
- include unmentioned module
- apply .npmignore last
- perf test: load large directory a couple of hundred times and ensure caching works

## Docs todo

- need a good example of applying a transformation via the API
- need a good example of using a transformation with the Express middleware
- local dev server example post detective support
- document the grunt task options that are available
- Express middleware dev config example (e.g. if(DEV) { build() } else { express.static('..'); }
- Using libraries with globals such as jQuery and underscore (and/or how to use --replace with big libs for greater efficiency)
  - how --replace works in this case
  - how cascading works when the desired target is a global var
  - how cascading works when the desired target is a require() function
  - how cascading works when the desired target is AMD
- Making use of --amd with RequireJS

## --cache-clean

TODO

`--cache-clean`: Clears the global cache folder by deleting it. This is always done before processing anything else.

# Known issues

- setting basepath to ./node_modules/foo causes the root to be empty rather than being based inside the package directory. E.g. you need to do require('foo') to get the result rather than require('./index.js');
- replace('foo', 'window.foo') applies to all subdependencies indiscriminately. Need a better syntax to control this. Old behavior was to only replace top level dependencies.

## --watch

TODO

Watch files for changes

.watch(function(err, text){ ...}): renders and adds file watchers on the files.

Note that this API is a bit clunky:

there is no way to unwatch a file other than terminate the program
on each watched file change, a console.log() message is shown
the API uses fs.watchFile(), so you do not get notification of newly added files in directories; watches are registered on the files that were used on the first render
But it works fine for automatically rebuilding e.g. when doing development locally.

# Tasks

- A better big lib handing system (e.g. --external backbone --external underscore)
- [browser field](https://gist.github.com/defunctzombie/4339901) support in package.json via [browser-resolve](https://github.com/defunctzombie/node-browser-resolve)
- Etags support for build results (e.g. shortcutting repeated loads even further)
- return a meaningful result from middleware if an error occurs
  (e.g. either a status code or perhaps even a div-printing thing)
- better metadata fetching from package.json
  - it should be possible to pre-filter the packages (before infer packages),
    so that devDependencies are not included in the processing
  - version numbers should be fetched
- ability to remap paths
  - e.g. add a file to the root from outside the root, with a different virtual filename
  - e.g. swap out the content a directory for the content of another one (shimming)

# Evaluation

- empirically based packaging / dynamic loading **
- Source maps support
- Fix issues with interrupted cached data
- Remapping cross environment dependencies / dependency injection
- Mocking out dependencies during testing/runtime **
- RequireJS to CommonJS conversion
- Easier conventions for adding a module both on the client and server side, e.g. only a node_modules entry => client side

# Internals

Phases:

- acquire file paths (e.g. via calls to .include and .npm)
    => result is a tree { files: [] } (under basepath)
    => note that nothing is excluded here
- filter file paths (e.g. remove excluded, remove .npmignore and so on)
- attach tasks
- run tasks
- squash result (or save to a directory)

File tasks:

- run-shell (e.g. run uglify)
- wrap-commonjs-web (e.g. wrap inside a function call)
- wrap-commonjs-web-sourceurl
- wrap-commonjs-amd (e.g. take commonJS files, resolve their direct dependencies, wrap into an AMD module)
- wrap-amd-commonjs-web (e.g. take a AMD file, look at the dependency declaration, convert that to a string, wrap into a web-commonjs module)

New features:

- vastly better conventions and support for writing dual-platform (browser + server) code that has some functions replaced with platform-specific equivalents
- Mocha test server and conventions to make it easy to repackage and run your Mocha tests inside a browser
- static file serving and Connect middleware
- better AMD interoperability: hook into AMD if that's the system being used; optionally export a `require()` implementation

Minor, but cool features:

- interoperate with libraries that use globals by binding variables under window.*
- continous rebuild via watcher
- build non-JS resources, for example compile Jade and Handlebars templates
- sourceURL support
- custom build task support
- better support for .npmignore files and filtering in general
- choice between throwing, or returning undefined in the require shim

# How do I ...?

## How do I build a single package from a existing Node.js project?

The easiest way is to use the command line tool:

    gluejs --out dist/radar_client.js

This auto-detects the package name and main file, and bundles the content of the current directory and subdirectories as well as any npm modules in them.

You can override this by explictly passing in various options - for example, if you only want to include the content of a single directory.

## How do I package tests for the browser?

There is a builtin Mocha test server task, which takes a set of tests as input and creates a server specifically for running one or more tests.

If you're not using Mocha, you can still use the API to create a package and serve it (with test-framework wrapping).

## How do I write dual-platform (browser + server) code using gluejs?

You have probably already been targeting both platforms - by writing code that can run in either environment. However, this is just one part of dual-platform coding.

Let me expand your horizon. All code falls into three categories:

- Code that works anywhere
- Code that is native on one platform, and needs to be shimmed / emulated / translated into remote procedure calls on the other
- Code that can only run on one platform

You've been writing code that works anywhere: where you explicitly avoid using API's that are not cross platform, or where you use 3rd party modules to hide the native APIs.

The second category: code that is native to one platform (node / browser), and shimmed on the other is what gluejs v2's conventions are targeting. This is the basic idea:

- Think of a single file (module) as a set of exports. The core file needs to be code that works anywhere - for example, data validation code in a Model usually doesn't depend on any external native APIs.
- Take the second category code - code that is native on one platform and shimmed on another - and split it into it's own file. Now have that file require the reusable core, and extend that core.

Here is an example core file `./lib/common/user.js`:

    function User(age) { this.age = age; }

    User.prototype.validate = function() {
      return this.age < 200 && this.age > 0;
    };

    module.exports = User;

and a shim file that extends that core `./lib/user.js`:

    var fs = require('fs'),
        User = require('./common/user.js');

    User.prototype.save = function() {
      fs.writeFileSync('~/userdata.js', JSON.stringify({ age: this.age }));
    };

    module.exports = User;
